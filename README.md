A university Digital Production Project.

// ## Project Overview

This project is an interactive voice user interface (VUI) web applications that allows users to interact with a virtual assistant named Harkn. The application is designed to provide users with a seamless experience in general information, ATM transactions, banking services, and accessing information through voice commands.

Originally this project was created with the intention of using an AI Agent to handle user requests. However, due to time constraints and technical challenges, the AI Agent functionality was not fully implemented. Instead, the application currently uses predefined responses and basic voice recognition capabilities to simulate interactions, dubbed HarknBravo.


## Features
- Voice Recognition: Users can interact with Harkn using voice commands.
- Predefined Responses: Harkn provides predefined responses to certain keywords to 'perform' common queries and tasks.

Predefined responses include:
- General Information: Weather updates, news, and other general queries.
- ATM Transactions: Simulated ATM transactions such as balance inquiries and fund transfers.
